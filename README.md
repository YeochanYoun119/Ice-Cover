# Ice-Cover
This program retrives dates and durations of full-freeze ice covers of Mendota lake in Wisconsin from [Wisconsin State Climatology Office](http://www.aos.wisc.edu/~sco/lakes/Mendota-ice.html). From this data, implement a linear regression to calculate predicted ice-cover duration on Mendota in expected future year.
